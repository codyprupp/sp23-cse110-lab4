1. values added:  20
2. final result:  20
3. values added:  20
4. ReferenceError: result is not defined
   
   The code returns an error because the `result` variable is defined using the `let` keyword, so it will not be able to be used outside of the `if` block that it is declared in. Since line 13 attempts to use `result` outside of the block, it throws an error.
5. TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
   
   The code returns an error because on line 7, the code attempts to reassign a value to `result`. However, `result` can't be redefined since it was originally defined as a constant, and thus an error is thrown.
6. The code does not make it to this line, as there is a compile error on line 7 for the reason discussed above.
